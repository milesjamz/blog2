		<h1> Data and Surveillance </h1>
			<h2>How does the average person generate private data?</h2>
	<p>A good example can be found <a href="blogminute.jpg">HERE<a>. In addition to to email, social media, text messages, etc., there is also an enormous amount of data generated by wearable devices and the internet of things. For instance, new cars generate about 25 gigabytes of data per hour. As the generation of personal data has increased exponentially in the last 20 years, this data has grown increasingly valuable, and therefore is treated like money; something corporations have a responsibility to make more of every year. Academics call this "surveillance capitalism."</p><br>
	<p>In addition to the obvious methods of collection, some companies also use <a href="beacons.png">ultrasonic beacons</a> embedded in ads that are then secretly picked up by your phone's microphone to record information like which ads you're listening to, and for how long.

	<br><br>

			<h2>Who collects it, and what do they do with it? </h2>
	<p>Google and Facebook are the leaders in collecting user data. It's recommended that you go to:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="google.com/takeout">google.com/takeout</a> for your <a href="googlehash.jpg">Google data</a>, and</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467">https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467</a> for your Facebook data.</li>
		</ul>
	This data is mainly used to sell precisely targeted advertisements, but is also sold to third parties. In 2016, the data brokerage business had an estimated value of over $200 billion dollars.

			<h2>The future</h2>
	<p> Currently, the USA, despite home to Silicon Valley, has no federal protections or regulations governing how personal information is collected and used by businesses.</p>
	<p> One alternative approach is being tried in the European Union, which enacted a regulation referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>, or General Data Protection Regulation, in 2018. Among other things, it requires businesses to clearly disclose when and how they collect personal data from users, make the highest privacy settings opted in to by default, report and data breaches within 72 hours, and opens tech companies to huge fines when violating any of these rules.</p>
	<p>Other ideas being put forward include putting an explicit dollar value on data, and enabling micropayments through cryptocurrency so that users are paid when their data is harvested and sold. So far, this has gained little traction, as people are content to provide their personal information for free.</p>
